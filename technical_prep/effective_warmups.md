## Learning Goals

* Identify tools and resources that provide exercises for warmups.
* Distinguish between high value and low value warmup activities.
* Practice warming up for the day.

## Warmup

* What do you do before your day starts to make sure you're ready to get started?

## Potential Warmup Activities

### Pre-teach/Re-teach

* Review the lessons for the day.
* Review the lessons from the previous day.

### Typing Practice (typing.io)

Ultimately you only need to type as fast as you can think. That said, being able to type quickly will allow you to take better notes, follow along as others are working, and efficiently work through problems.

There are many ways to increase your typing speed. One specifically designed to increase your typing speed for code is [typing.io](https://typing.io/).

Go ahead and visit that site now. Pick a language of your choice and try to see how long it takes you to get through their code sample.

Be sure to add this link to your Turing bookmarks!

### Review Some Shortcuts

Try to introduce shortcuts into your workflow on a daily basis. You won't be able to learn all of these at once, so make a commitment to learn them slowly.

For a list of shortcuts that you might want to start with visit [this](./shortcuts) page.

#### OOP

In order to practice OOP, we're going to start by trying to take something from our lives and turn it into code. In order to do that, let's take it one step at a time:

* Plan your class
    * Think of a thing
    * List attributes that thing might have
    * List behaviors that thing might have
* Build your class
    * Define class
    * Add attributes (instance variables)
    * Add empty methods
* Use your class
    * Create a runner file
    * Require the file with your class
    * Initialize an instance of your new class
    * Call some methods on that instance
* Extension (if you have extra time)
    * Create a second class that might interact with the first
    * Use the two classes together in your runner file

#### HTML/CSS

* Wireframing
    * Find a site that you like.
    * Draw a wireframe for that site.
    * Collect some content that you can use.
        * [Lorem Ipsum](https://www.lipsum.com/) or [Zombie Ipsum](http://www.zombieipsum.com/) if you're feeling spicy.
        * [Images](https://unsplash.com/).
* Generate HTML
    * If you're still feeling unsure about HTML tags, [review them](http://frontend.turing.io/independent-study/html-cheat-sheet.html).
    * Otherwise, take the wireframe that you drew and begin creating HTML that has each of the pieces you identified.
    * Use the content that you collected above.
* Generate CSS
    * If you're not yet comfortable defining CSS rules, [review that process](http://frontend.turing.io/independent-study/html-css-cheat-sheet.html).
    * Otherwise, take the HTML that you've created and style it.
